## Salary by position across the years

This plot shows the range of salaries at each position at different year. We can use the slider to choose which year you want to looking at. Also, when you move to each bar, it can show the exact salary. We are curious about which position can make the most money in a baseball game. So we combined "salary" and "fielding" these two datasets together in one dataframe called "player_position." Because we already explored these two datasets and found out that they both have "playerID" and "yearID," then we merged them and created a new dataset with only four colums.

Initially, we showed the data as a line graph for each position across the years. This plot shows all the positions as a bar graph for a given year. Sliding through the years gives a more visual contrast to how the pay rates have changed.
